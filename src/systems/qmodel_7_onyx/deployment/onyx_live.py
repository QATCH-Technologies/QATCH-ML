"""
QATCH.QModel.models.qmodel_onyx.onyx_live.py

This module provides the infrastructure for running a YOLO-based fill classifier
in a live, multiprocessing environment. It includes a classification logic class
that manages data buffering and prediction, as well as a dedicated multiprocessing
wrapper to handle execution in a separate process, ensuring non-blocking performance
for the main application.

The live classifier only depends on the fill-classifier and config surfaces of the
predictor (`QModelOnyxConfig`, `QModelOnyxFillClassifier`), so it is wired to the
consolidated Onyx predictor module here.

    It continuously consumes raw worker data from an input queue, processes it,
    runs inference, and pushes the results to an output queue. This design ensures
    that computationally expensive inference does not block the main application loop.

    Output queue items are `(int, str, Optional[str])` tuples:

    * `int`  - the raw prediction class ID (e.g., -1, 0, 1, 2, 3).
    * `str`  - the human-readable status label (e.g., "2 Channels").
    * `Optional[str]` - a one-shot on-display message for the main UI, or `None`
      if no message is pending. The message is emitted at most once per channel
      state transition and is consumed by the first call that reads it.

    Attributes:
        _queueLog (multiprocessing.Queue): Queue for thread-safe logging.
        _exit (multiprocessing.Event): Event flag to signal process termination.

        model_path (str): Path to the YOLO model file.
        buffer_window_size (Optional[int]): Rolling window size for the model
            buffer. None (the default) means unbounded, which is correct for
            this whole-prefix classifier.
