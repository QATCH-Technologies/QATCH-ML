rendering/detector_render.py
=============================

Version-2 detection-image renderer, addressing the two representation
failures the v7 training run exposed:

  1. LATE-EVENT FLATTENING. Per-strip global percentile normalization makes
     the early fill step own the entire dynamic range; late POIs in long
     viscous runs become featureless flat plateaus - the regions where ch2
     trained to recall 0.63 and ch3 collapsed. The fix is not a cleverer
     amplitude normalization (any global value scaling keeps the step
     dominant): it is to render what the detector is actually supposed to
     find. POIs are TRANSITIONS, so the third strip is replaced with a
     DERIVATIVE-ENERGY trace: the combined, robustly-scaled, log-compressed
     |d/dt| of dissipation and resonance frequency. Events appear as bright
     vertical ridges with near-uniform salience regardless of where in the
     run they occur or how large the absolute amplitude change is. The
     Difference curve it replaces is a linear combination of the two value
     strips and carried little independent information.

  2. The dissipation (R) and resonance (G) value strips are kept exactly as
     v1 renders them (same percentile normalization, fill + white outline),
     so global fill-context cues the detectors already exploit are
     preserved.

Train/inference contract: this module is used by BOTH build_dataset.py and
the production predictor (QModelOnyxConfig.RENDER_VERSION). The render the
weights were trained on MUST be the render they see at inference; the
version flag exists precisely so old (v1-trained) weights keep working
while v2-trained weights roll out.
