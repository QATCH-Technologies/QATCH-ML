dp_decode.py
============

Joint configuration decode over YOLO candidate detections.

Problem
-------
The production cascade keeps only the single highest-confidence detection per
POI (`best_dets`) and cuts the signal at it. That greedy, per-POI choice is
exactly what produces locally-plausible-but-globally-illogical placements, and
because the cascade *cuts* on each pick, one bad early detection corrupts every
later one.

This module replaces the greedy pick with a global decode: given several
CANDIDATE detections per present POI (time + confidence), choose one candidate
per POI such that the configuration is

    (a) strictly time-ordered (hard),
    (b) feasible under the learned per-gap bounds (hard, with slack),
    (c) maximal in   sum(detection confidence)  +  lambda * spacing log-lik,

where the spacing log-likelihood comes from the learned SpacingPrior. This is
the EDA-selected design: flat, pairwise prior + monotonic constraint, solved
exactly by dynamic programming over the candidate lattice.

Span handling (important)
-------------------------
The prior's span-fraction component was fitted on COMPLETE fills with
span = t(POI5) - t(POI1). Two consequences honoured here:

  * On partial (prefix) fills the fraction component is RE-REFERENCED to
    the span of the present prefix via SpacingPrior.gap_loglik_scoped (the
    fitted frac medians assume the complete-fill span and would otherwise be
    systematically biased). This keeps the scale-coupling - the observed
    early gaps anchor the run's scale and later gaps must be proportionate -
    active on partial fills, where it is the main defence against
    fast-fill-shaped decoy configurations on slow (high-viscosity) runs.
    With fewer than three placed POIs there is no ratio information and the
    density is seconds-only.
  * The span is not known until the configuration is chosen, and a
    per-edge "span so far" proxy breaks DP optimality. But the span is
    FULLY DETERMINED by the first and last placed candidates, so the decode
    conditions on that pair: for each (first, last) candidate combination it
    runs an exact DP with the span fixed, and keeps the best consistently
    re-scored configuration. With the per-POI candidate cap this is at most
    K^2 small DPs and yields the exact argmax of the blended objective -
    no fixed-point approximation that could converge to the wrong basin
    (e.g. a compressed fast-fill-shaped decoy on a slow run).

Non-adjacent present POIs (e.g. POI2 and POI4 present with POI3 unplaceable)
are scored against the COMPOSITION of the intervening fitted gaps via
SpacingPrior.composed_stat, not against the first gap's stats.

It only decodes the POIs that are actually present (the fill-count gate /
type_cls has already decided how many channels exist), so partial fills are
handled by passing fewer POIs - no spurious late POIs are introduced.

Inputs / outputs are plain dicts so this drops in alongside the existing
predictor without depending on its internals.
