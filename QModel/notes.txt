The overarching idea here is to do some kind of bias correction.
Essentially, I want to take the predictions from QMultiModel, establish a bias based on our test data, and then perform a bias correction based on a pre-established bias for each
layer of the predictor.
For example, if POI is consistently under-predicted, feed the prediction results as well as some way of representing an under-prediction bias to a final model to make final judgement 
on POI 1.

1. Make predictions on a validation dataset

2. Calculate Residuals
residuals = y_test - y_pred

3. Feed data to secondary model
X is my test data and the residulas are now my target.
Split this data into training and test

4.  Use a seconary model to predict on the residuals and adjust original predictions
adjusted_predictions = y_pred + bias_pred
# Convert adjusted predictions to binary (for classification tasks)
y_pred_adjusted = (adjusted_predictions > 0.5).astype(int)
